# Agent Instructions — Spike.sh LinkedIn Post Generator

## What this project does

Reads published guides from a Notion database and generates LinkedIn posts from them — one post per sharp idea extracted from each guide. Everything runs through Claude Code + Notion MCP.

---

## How to run it

Use the `/run` master command. It scans everything pending and handles it all in one shot:
- Generated posts with unresolved inline comments → applies edits
- Posts with Status = Approved → generates image prompts
- Guides with Posts Generated = unchecked → generates posts

Individual commands for targeted runs:
- `/generate-posts` — generate posts for unprocessed guides only
- `/apply-edits` — apply pending inline comment edits only
- `/generate-image-prompts` — generate image prompts for Approved posts only

All command logic lives in `.claude/commands/`.

## Post status lifecycle

`Generated` → user reviews and adds inline comments → `/run` applies edits (status stays Generated) → user changes to `Approved` → `/run` generates image prompt → `Ready to publish` → user publishes on LinkedIn → `Published` → user logs analytics

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Generated | Yellow | Post written to Notion, awaiting review |
| Approved | Purple | User has reviewed and approved — triggers image prompt generation |
| Ready to publish | Blue | Image prompt generated, ready to go live |
| Published | Green | Live on LinkedIn |

---

## Edit detection (comment-based)

The pipeline auto-detects unresolved comment threads (threads with no "Applied." reply) on all Generated posts. It applies the requested changes and replies "Applied." to each thread. Status stays Generated throughout — the user manually changes to Approved when satisfied.

---

## Review system

Posts go through a 5-persona review board before being written to Notion. One Haiku agent runs all 5 personas in sequence and returns scores in a single response.

**Gate:** Overall average >= 7.5 AND every individual persona score >= 7

**Hard rules** (automatic score below 7): em dashes, banned words
**Soft rules** (proportional deductions, not auto-fails): word count (90–160), comma count, hedging presence, standalone sentences of 3 words or fewer

Maximum 2 auto-rewrite rounds before the pipeline pauses and asks the user how to proceed.

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `instructions.txt` | Full writing brief: audience, tone, structure, rules, banned words, reference posts |
| `opinions.md` | Sharp opinions extracted from processed guides — used when generating new posts |
| `image-guide.md` | Visual style guide for image prompt generation — color palette, rules, 5 reference examples |
| `review-logs/` | Per-guide review logs — one `.md` file per guide, written after each pipeline run |
| `.claude/commands/run.md` | Master pipeline command |
| `.claude/commands/generate-posts.md` | Full post generation pipeline with 5-persona review board (single Haiku agent) |
| `.claude/commands/apply-edits.md` | Comment-based edit application |
| `.claude/commands/generate-image-prompts.md` | Image prompt generation for Approved posts |

## Important behaviours

- Never mark a guide as Posts Generated = true unless posts were successfully written to Notion
- Skip guides with empty content and move to the next one
- Only act on comment threads with no "Applied." reply — skip already-handled threads
- Never write posts to Notion until the review gate is passed (or the user explicitly chooses to write as-is)
- Read `instructions.txt`, `opinions.md`, and `image-guide.md` fresh on every run — never rely on cached memory
- Linked Guide relation value format: JSON array of page URLs — `["https://www.notion.so/{page-id-no-dashes}"]`
- Haiku agent miscounts word length by ~20–30% — verify word count manually if Copy Editor flags an out-of-range count on a post that looks normal length
