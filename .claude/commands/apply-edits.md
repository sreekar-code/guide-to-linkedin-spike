# /apply-edits

Apply pending edits to LinkedIn posts. Scans all `Generated` posts for unresolved comment threads, applies the changes, and replies "Applied." to each thread. No status change needed from you.

## Notion Database IDs
See `AGENTS.md` for database IDs and schema details.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find Posts With Unresolved Comments

1. Search the LinkedIn Posts DB to retrieve every post page. Do not rely on post IDs from session memory. If the search returns `has_more: true`, continue fetching with `next_cursor` until all pages are retrieved. For each post returned, fetch its page to read the `Status` property. Collect only posts where `Status = Generated`.
2. For each Generated post, fetch comments using `get_comments` with `include_all_blocks: true`
3. A post has **unresolved comments** if it has at least one comment thread where none of the replies contain "Applied."
4. Collect only posts with unresolved comments

If none found, tell the user: "No Generated posts have unresolved comments." and stop.

List the posts found:
```
Found N post(s) with unresolved comments:
- [Post Title] (N unresolved thread(s))
- [Post Title] (N unresolved thread(s))
...
```

### Step 2: For Each Post — Apply Edits

For each post with unresolved comments:

1. Fetch the full post page content from Notion (to get the current Post Content)
2. Read through all unresolved comment threads — these are the edit instructions
3. Skip any thread that already has an "Applied." reply (already handled in a previous run)

**Applying edits:**
- Treat each unresolved comment as a specific instruction to change something in the post
- Apply every comment's requested change to the post content
- If a comment is ambiguous, use judgment to make the most reasonable interpretation — do not ask for clarification mid-run
- Preserve everything not mentioned in the comments (structure, tone, word count, all rules from `instructions.txt`)
- After applying edits, read `instructions.txt` fresh and verify the post complies with all its rules. Key checks:
  - No em dashes
  - No banned words (ensure, enhance, leverage, utilize, "for example", "imagine", "tends", draining, relentless)
  - No more than one comma per sentence
  - 90-160 words in body (excluding P.S.)
  - No bold inside the post body
  - 3-5 relevant hashtags at end (after P.S.)
  - No instructional language
  - UK-style hedging language present (at least one phrase per post is sufficient)
  - No excessive -ing words
  - "incident" not "alert" — never use "alert" to describe an incident

4. Update the post's `Post Content` field in Notion with the revised text
5. Reply to each unresolved comment thread with: `Applied.`
6. Status remains `Generated` — do not change it

### Step 3: Report to User

After processing all posts:

```
Edits applied — N post(s) updated

[Post Title]
  Comments addressed: N

[Post Title]
  Comments addressed: N

Note: Comments remain open in Notion — resolve them manually once you've reviewed the changes.
```

## Important Rules

- Only act on threads with no "Applied." reply — skip already-handled threads
- Never change content that wasn't mentioned in a comment
- Apply edits faithfully — do not rewrite the post beyond what the comment requests
- If an edit would violate `instructions.txt` rules, fix the violation while honoring the spirit of the edit
- Do not change the post's status — it stays `Generated`
- Process posts one at a time, sequentially
